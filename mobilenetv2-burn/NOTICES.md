## Pre-trained Model

The ImageNet pre-trained model was ported from [`torchvision.models.MobileNet_V2_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2.html#torchvision.models.MobileNet_V2_Weights).

As opposed to [other pre-trained models](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.regnet_y_128gf.html#torchvision.models.RegNet_Y_128GF_Weights) in `torchvision`, no specific license was linked to the weights, which are assumed to be under the library's [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/LICENSE) ([ref](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/160)).
